# captureFace

This is an attempt to extract a simple example of how to capture a face from a webcam and render it onto a 3D geometry. It uses three.js and clmtrackr and borrows large amounts of code from the clmtracker examples as well as from the KAMRA-Deja-Vu project.

To test the examples locally, you need to run a local server. One easy way to do this is to install `http-server`, a small node.js utility: `npm install -g http-server`. Then run `http-server` in the directory to which you cloned this project and go to `https://localhost:8080/` in your browser.
